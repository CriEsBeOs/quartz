The Center XL Assembly onÂ [[RWTH Campus Research Clusters]] promotes the idea of resilient and sustainable assembly systems and its necessitated metrology-assisted production chains. Its members are enabled to apply cutting-edge technologies, such as omnidirectional conveyance systems, self-optimizing processes and agile reconfiguration measures facilitated by Cyber-Physical Production Systems.
